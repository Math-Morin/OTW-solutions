# OTW-solutions

Here are my solutions some of the challenges from online CTF [OverTheWire](https://overthewire.org/wargames/).

- [Bandit](https://github.com/Math-Morin/OTW-solutions/tree/main/bandit)
- [Natas](https://github.com/Math-Morin/OTW-solutions/tree/main/natas)

## What I learned:

### Bandit
- Basic Linux and shell skills 
- ssh, git, find, grep, vim, etc.
- Emacs org-mode and org-roam to build knowledge base and organise solutions 

### Natas
- Basic web AppSec
- awareness to vulnerabilities in code
- Use Python scripts to interact with web apps and APIs.
- Run scripts from within Emacs org-mode to have efficient code writing and note taking in same file.
