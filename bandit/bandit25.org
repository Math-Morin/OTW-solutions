* Notes

#+begin_src bash
cat /etc/passwd | grep bandit26
#+end_src
reveals that bandit26 runs a script as a 'shell'.
This script runs more on a small file which contains an ASCII banner.

You can interact with vi from within 'more', with the `v` key.

Then you can use the `:e` commands in vi to get the "/etc/bandit_pass/bandit26" flag.
